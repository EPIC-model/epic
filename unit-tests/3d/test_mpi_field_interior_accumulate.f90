!                       Test MPI field interior accumulate
!
!   This unit test checks accumulating the field interior. Each grid point
!   (including halo) is assigned the value of 1. After
!   accumulating the interior values, each interior grid point overlapping
!   with halo grid points from other processes should be assigned a value of
!   n+1, where n is the number of processes that share the grid point.
