In order to compile Scalasca and Score-P please use the scripts provided in this directory.
Before you install them, you need to export following environment variables:

DOWNLOADS_DIR -- location where to download the tar file
SRC_DIR       -- location where to unpack the tar file
PREFIX        -- installation directory (the bin directory will be in $PREFIX/bin)
NJOBS         -- the number of cores used in the "make" command.

(e.g. export NJOBS=4)

After installing the libraries, add the path of the bin directory to your $PATH
environment variable (e.g. export PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH).

Under licenses/ (of the root directory) you can find a copy of all licenses.
