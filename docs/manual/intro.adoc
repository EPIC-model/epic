The EPIC framework is an open-source project developed to simulate fluid flows where the Lagrangian parcels are
described by ellipses in 2D and ellipsoids in 3D. Although EPIC targets the simulation
of cloud and atmospheric systems, the core idea of advecting elliptical parcels is applicable to any fluid dynamical
system.
